# Awesome QUIC [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A collection of various awesome lists for videos, pentesters, libraries and frameworks.

**QUIC** is the Quick UDP Internet Connections protocol, developed by Google and currently in IETF workgroups for further development. It is being considered for replacing TCP as a transport protocol for HTTP/3. We are building an Open source project for IoT & Edge Computing atop QUIC called ü¶ñ[YoMo](https://github.com/yomorun/yomo/)

* [@Daniel Stenberg](https://twitter.com/bagder) 's blog: WHERE IS HTTP/3 RIGHT NOW?, said the specifications are all done. They‚Äôre now waiting in queues to get their final edits and approvals before they will get assigned RFC numbers and get published as such ‚Äì they will not change any further.
* netray.io scans the IPv4 address space weekly and checks how many hosts that speak QUIC. Their latest scan found 2.1 million such hosts.

* All the major browsers have HTTP/3 implementations and most of them allow you to manually enable it if it isn‚Äôt already done so. Chrome and Edge have it enabled by default and Firefox will so very soon

* Microsoft's [open-source implementation of the QUIC protocol](https://github.com/microsoft/msquic) that will form the basis of HTTP/3 will be in Windows Server 2022. It's being used for [SMB over QUIC](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/itops-talk-blog/smb-over-quic-files-without-the-vpn/ba-p/1183449), which is a more secure replacement for WebDAV to deliver SMB access **without the expense and complexity of a VPN**. This uses QUIC as the transport for SMB **instead of TCP/IP** and RDMA, with a tunnel that secures SMB **even if encryption isn't enabled**. "SMB over QUIC will be available with Azure Automanage and Windows Server 2022," Kumar told TechRepublic. "It will also be supported as a client in Windows 10 and on third-party platforms like Android and others."

However,QUIC DATAGRAM frames do not provide a means to demultiplex application contexts.  This document defines how to use QUIC DATAGRAM frames when the application protocol running over QUIC is HTTP/3 by adding an identifier at the start of the frame payload. This allows HTTP messages to convey related information using unreliable DATAGRAM frames, ensuring those frames are properly associated with an HTTP message.

* **Paper** [Implementation and analysis of QUIC for MQTT](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329835020_Implementation_and_analysis_of_QUIC_for_MQTT)
  * Transport and security protocols are essential to ensure reliable and secure communication between two parties. For IoT applications, these protocols must be lightweight, since IoT devices are usually resource constrained. Unfortunately, the existing transport and security protocols ‚Äì namely TCP/TLS and UDP/DTLS ‚Äì fall short in terms of connection overhead, latency, and connection migration when used in IoT applications. In this paper, after studying the root causes of these shortcomings, we show how utilizing QUIC in IoT scenarios results in a higher performance. Based on these observations, and given the popularity of MQTT as an IoT application layer protocol, we integrate MQTT with QUIC. By presenting the main APIs and functions developed, we explain how connection establishment and message exchange functionalities work. We evaluate the performance of MQTTw/QUIC versus MQTTw/TCP using wired, wireless, and long-distance testbeds. Our results show that MQTTw/QUIC reduces connection overhead in terms of the number of packets exchanged with the broker by up to 56%. In addition, by eliminating half-open connections, MQTTw/QUIC reduces processor and memory usage by up to 83% and 50%, respectively. Furthermore, by removing the head-of-line blocking problem, delivery latency is reduced by up to 55%. We also show that the throughput drops experienced by MQTTw/QUIC when a connection migration happens is considerably lower than that of MQTTw/TCP.

* **Article** [QUIC and IoT](https://calendar.perfplanet.com/2018/quic-and-http-3-too-big-to-fail/)
  * One of the oft-touted use cases for QUIC is in Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, as they often need intermittent (cellular) network access and low-latency connection setup, 0-RTT and better loss resilience are quite interesting in those cases. However, those devices often also have quite slow CPUs.. There are many issues where QUIC‚Äôs designers mention the IoT use case and how a certain decision might impact this, though as far as I know there is no stack that has been tested on such hardware yet. Similarly, many issues mention taking into account a hardware QUIC implementation, but at my experience level it‚Äôs unclear if this is more wishful thinking and handwaving rather than a guarantee.

* **Adoption** [Chrome is deploying HTTP/3 and IETF QUIC](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/10/chrome-is-deploying-http3-and-ietf-quic.html)
  * current latest Google QUIC version (Q050) has many similarities with IETF QUIC. But up until now, the majority of Chrome users didn't communicate with IETF QUIC servers without enabling some command-line options.
  * Google search latency decreases by over 2%. YouTube rebuffer time decreased by over 9%, while client throughput increased by over 3% on desktop and over 7% on mobile. We're happy to announce that Chrome is rolling out support for IETF QUIC (specifically, draft version h3-29)
  * Today 25% of Chrome Stable users are using h3-29, and we plan on increasing that number over the coming weeks as we continue to monitor performance data
  * Chrome will actively support both IETF QUIC h3-29 and Google QUIC Q050 to provide servers that support Q050 with time to update to IETF QUIC.
* **Adoption** Cloudflare begins emailing users that [H3 will be automatically enabled](https://cloudflare-quic.com/) starting this month
* CDNs are misunderstood these days. Caching at the browser across sites is not that important, it caching at a point of presence (POP). This POP being so much closer to your end users brings performance gains because TCP is terrible over distances. QUIC may fix this by it's shift to UDP.
